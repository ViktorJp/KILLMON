v1.1 - (TBA)
       * FIXED: Found a minor typo in the ip6rules table logic

v1.0 - (November 29, 2022)
       * MAJOR: KILLMON v1.0 goes live today!
       * CHANGED: Most recent major mod was removing all IPv6 related info in the UI if IP6 is turned off at the router
         level, and will only display IP4-related settings.
       * FIXED: Minor code changes and enhancements to bring it up to the same back-end functional level as VPNMON-R2,
         RTRMON and PWRMON.
