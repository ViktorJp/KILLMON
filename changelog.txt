v1.01  - (December 9, 2022)
         * FIXED: Found a minor typo in the ip6tables logic

v1.0   - (November 29, 2022)
         * MAJOR: KILLMON v1.0 goes live today!
         * CHANGED: Most recent major mod was removing all IPv6 related info in the UI if IP6 is turned off at the router
           level, and will only display IP4-related settings.
         * FIXED: Minor code changes and enhancements to bring it up to the same back-end functional level as VPNMON-R2,
           RTRMON and PWRMON.
