v1.1.1   - 

v1.05    - (February 20, 2023)
         * FIXED: Fixed some of the logic when it came to killmon being out of sync with the contents of the firewall-start
           file and its accompanying killmon.cfg settings.  Thanks to @DAVID LONG for bringing this to my attention. Also
           fixed the uninstall routine to make sure the firewall-start file has been cleared of its killmon entry.

v1.04    - (January 22, 2023)
         * ADDED: Some logic was added under the Operations section to determine whether or not to suppress the KILLMON
           header on the main VPNMON-R2 UI along with the associated logging that happens. If you have KILLMON installed
           but not running or enabled, VPNMON-R2 would display warnings that KILLMON is disabled and that rule integrity is
           compromised.  You can now suppress or enable this info in VPNMON-R2 from within the KILLMON UI v1.04.
         * ADDED: The ability to show/hide the options to help declutter the UI a bit more. 
         * FIXED: Other minor optimizations and code cleanup to help simplify the UI

v1.01    - (December 9, 2022)
         * FIXED: Found a minor typo in the ip6tables logic. If you currently have IP6 rules enabled, please disable and
           re-enable to reset them.

v1.0     - (November 29, 2022)
         * MAJOR: KILLMON v1.0 goes live today!
         * CHANGED: Most recent major mod was removing all IPv6 related info in the UI if IP6 is turned off at the router
           level, and will only display IP4-related settings.
         * FIXED: Minor code changes and enhancements to bring it up to the same back-end functional level as VPNMON-R2,
           RTRMON and PWRMON.
